#Personal Info
Hello, my name is Darren Borkett. I am an Australian and have lived in beautiful, sunny Queensland for most of my adult life and grew up in Vietnam prior to that. I used to speak Vietnamese fluently but have not spoken it for many years so that skill is a bit rusty. At present, I am working as a cleaner part time which I have done for four years now. I enjoy the job but hope to eventually change my career path. I have a passion for music and play a few musical instruments, mainly piano, violin and guitar in a range of musical styles. I love to learn new things and I completed a Bachelor of Accounting back in 2011. Currently, I am working towards graded exams on both piano and violin and thoroughly enjoying it. I also have two very happy canaries who are noisy but are easy to look after. I am excited to be doing University study again and look forward to an interesting and challenging learning curve throughout my IT degree.

#Interest in IT
I first became interested in Information Technology when I experimented with different programming languages, such as Visual Basic and Python, when I was younger but I never committed to fully studying them. I grew up using computers just like the rest of my generation and therefore confident with navigating around the Windows desktop. IT is a new area of discipline for me and I have no experience in the industry, but am keen to learn as much as I can through the online degree that I am currently doing. There are many areas of IT that appeal to me, especially programming, app development and diagnosing computer problems.

I chose to do an IT degree through RMIT because I prefer online study as I currently work part time, have an interest in learning about the vast world of technology and hope to turn it into a viable career. There were many study options to choose from through Open Universities Australia, but I felt that the Bachelor of Information Technology was one of the most practical and realistic in terms of changing careers. Also, RMIT has a major focus on IT, so I wanted a good foundation in the necessary practical skills to work in the industry. It also fits in with my work and there is not a lot of travel like traditional on campus, as well as the fact that it is a fascinating subject.

Most areas of Information Technology are interesting and I like the idea of being able to invent a useful or fun product. This is one of the reasons why I like app development as a possible career choice. Programming, game design and repairing computers are also possible areas I would like to learn more about. IT skills are adaptable to many different industries, and I expect to learn many different tech terms and technologies, as well as how to program in a few different programming languages and to also better understand realistic IT career options. It is an exciting career path that requires several different skills and knowledge but also adaptable to most industries.

#Ideal Job

The job advertisment on the Seek website for the role of Mobile Application Developer through 'Hays Information Technology' is detailed and demands many technical IT skills, which include programming, web design and a pp building knowledge ('Mobile Applications Developer', 2019). This position appeals to me because I am interested in becoming an app developer, enjoy programming and am willing to put in the years of effort required to fulfill the role. I also like the idea of being able to create something new or useful to potential clients or users. The adverstisement clearly indicates that a breadth of software and Information Technology concepts are necessary to be considered for the role.

The skills and experience wanted by the employer are clearly highlighted in the advertisement, with programming, teamwork, app design and web design as key areas of interest. The ad specifies Java, Objective C and Swift as the programming languages wanted, as well as an understanding of Crashlytics and Reach Native softwares ('Mobile Applications Developer', 2019). As the role requires many technical skills, a Bachelor of Information Technology or equivalent would be needed. As the world of IT is still fairly new to me, years of study and experience will be needed before I could take the job.

While I do not have any experience in the IT industry, I have worked in other jobs, including as a tax consultant and currently as a cleaner. I also volunteered at a recycled clothing store and completed Year 12 and a university degree in Accounting. I enjoy problem solving, which is another reason I chose IT and I am currently studying a Bachelor of Information Technology through RMIT with Open Universities Australia. I have a strong work ethic as well as good writing skills. I expect to develop many of the technical skills required through the subjects but may have to do extra study in the other areas outlined in the job advertisement.

As the ad specifies many technical skills, as well as many other IT processes and software requirements, I will probably have to extra research in the areas not covered by the subjects in the degree. I will also have to learn the app and website development process, which will be a steep learning curve but I am willing to put in the necessary effort.

#Personal Profile

I recently did three online personality test and the link to the results are included at the end of this webpage. The first was an online Myers-Briggs personaliy test, which indicates that I am an INTJ, which stands for Introvert, Intuitive, Thinking and Judging ('Humanmetics Jung Typology Test', 2019). This means I have a tendency to develop my own ideas, am determined but also independent and stubborn (Kaluzniacky, 2014). In a team situation, this means I can easily work on part of a project independently and be keen to succeed, but may have to work on listening to others' contributions. The second test is an online learning styles test which indicates I learn best through visual aids and least through hearing ('Your Personality Max Report', 2019). This means I would benefit from charts, diagrams, mind maps and other visual aids to communicate project ideas. The third result is from an online Big Five Personality test through which I scored moderately in agreeableness and natural reactions, but low in work ethic, openness to new experiences and extraversion ('Big Five Personality Test Report', 2019). All three tests indicate that I am an introvert but the third test does not reflect my strong work ethic. As an introvert, this may impact group presentations as this requires strong verbal communication. When joining a team, I need to take into account the need to constantly stay communicating.

#Project Idea

##Overview

The IT Project will be a simple productivity mobile application for android aimed at businesses and maybe individuals. It will include several organisational features which will be updated and changed as required. It may be available through the Google Play Store and a name is yet to be decided on. There will be uploading, recording, notetaking, notifications and even an option for employee’s birthdays to name a few of the ideas. More details are discussed below.

##Motivation

In June 2018, there was an estimated total of more than 2.3 billion businesses operating in Australia, so there is a huge market for a business productivity mobile application (‘Australian business counts increase for the fifth consecutive year’, 2019). As there are a large number of differing industries, it is nearly impossible to cater for each one, but the app can offer specific features to some of the most common ones. It will be useful as it aims to help businesses to keep important records and have a visual aid for planning purposes for relevant industries.

##Description

The mobile application will have several useful features, most of which will be customisable by the user. Firstly, there will be a notifications feature that can be set to daily, weekly, fortnightly or monthly via a settings in the app. These notifications can include messages for important business meetings, employee’s birthdays and project deadlines. Secondly, it will include a recordings option, that allows podcasting, video and audio uploads. Thirdly, it will have a customisable diary, calendar and to do list. It will also have a feature that allows for industry specific planning such as seating arrangements and recipe creator for hospitality, toolbox records for trade workers, and an expense tracker. It will be password protected and include a feature for uploading and syncing important documents. There will be an option to alter time zones for different countries. The app will be compatible with android devices and may also become available to iphone and mac computers.

The app is aimed at business owners who would like an app to keep company records as well as planning features relevant to their industry. Additional features may be added and existing ones will be updated as required. As it is not possible to cater for every industry but some of the common specific ones will have special settings and more of these may be added over time. The user interface will be touchscreen and easy to navigate, with drop down menus and a search function. There will be an option to save data either as an individual or a group. Extra functions such as a calculator and metric conversion may also be included. The mobile application is intended to be of benefit to various businesses but also be helpful for personal users so may include future features aimed at individuals as well. Regular updates and bug fixes will also be part of maintaining the mobile app and may become available via the Google Play store. At present, it is intended for mobile phone use but a compatible software version for Windows and Mac will be considered at a later date, offering an extra platform to save and sync the user’s important data.

As it is a productivity application, the layout will be simple, with not too many confusing graphics and maybe a tutorial if it is needed. A help or frequently asked question section feature may also be included and updated regularly. The general design will need to be developed over time and features that do not aid the program’s functionality will be either altered or removed as needed. Features that analyse number of downloads and user interest may need to be incorporated (Varshneya, 2004). This will help with necessary feedback that will lead to further improvements and to ensure the product works as intended.

##Tools and Technologies

MIT App Inventor will be used as a starting point because it is much simpler than traditional programming platforms and targets android devices, as well as allowing the created app to be distributed through the Google Play Store (‘About Us’, 2019). Other options may be researched and considered if it is needed during the development process. As I am inexperienced, this platform may be much simpler to work with than detailed programming languages such as Visual Basic or Java. The final product will be tested on an android phone.

##Skills Required

The successful development of the mobile application will require careful planning and learning of the chosen platform, which is currently MIT App Inventor. Developing a practical and easy to use user interface will be part of the challenge and is a skill that is needed in the ideal job discussed earlier. Research into how to create and implement the several planned features will also be a large part of the development process.

##Outcome

The aim of the final product is to have an app that is simple to use and helps with productivity, with a focus on business use. The outcome will hopefully be a useful app to various industries but also individuals who want to store important data and project plans and ideas. It will be aimed at android as this is easily accessible but may extend to a desktop and iphone version in the future if successful.
